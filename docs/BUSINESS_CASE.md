Business Case: QuickRankU
Market Problem
Students and families face significant challenges finding colleges that match both their academic goals and financial constraints. With over 4,000 colleges in the U.S. offering diverse programs and tuition rates, the college selection process has become overwhelming and expensive.

Current Market Pain Points
Information Overload: Students struggle to efficiently compare colleges across major-specific rankings and pricing
High Advisory Costs: College counseling services range from $4,000-$15,000 for complete packages, creating barriers for middle-income families
Generic Rankings: Existing platforms provide general "Top 50" lists without considering individual budget constraints and major preferences simultaneously
Market Opportunity
Target Market Size
Primary Market: 19 million U.S. students and parents making tuition-driven college decisions annually
Current Spending: Families already invest over $1,000 yearly on college counseling and search tools
Market Gap: No existing solution effectively combines major-specific rankings with personalized budget filtering
Competitive Landscape
